# Unit 15: Project 2

## Overview

Welcome to Project 2! This is yet another important milestone in your full-stack journey: designing and building your first full-stack web application. You and your team will design and build an app using the MVC paradigm, create your own server-side API, add user authentication, and connect to a database.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Full-stack applications

* [Git branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)

* [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Homework

With your team, youâ€™ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative full-stack application, youâ€™ll combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. Youâ€™ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies youâ€™ve used throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

Instead of using the front end you developed for your first project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify your understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, youâ€™ve likely improved your skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now you can build a better application, using all of the additional practice youâ€™ve had in the last several weeks.

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you'll continue to work on your group projects. You'll end the week by presenting your project to your class. Once your project is complete, you'll want to update your professional materials and add your new project to your portfolio.
